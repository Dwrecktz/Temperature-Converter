# Temperature Converter
The temperature converter is used for converting Farenheit to Celcius, vice-versa.

# How to use:
Downlod VsCode or Visual Studio. Create a new C# Console App Project. Copy and paste the Program.cs file into your project, and then change the namespace to whatever you want.

# Running:
Press F5 on your keyboard (or run), and then it will run the program. Input either 1 or 2 to select the conversion method. Then input both of your input's, and see the conversion. Additionally, you can create a .exe file for easy access.

# Modification:
To change the color of the text, go to `Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;` and set Green to the color you want.
